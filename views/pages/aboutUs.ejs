            <p>My name is Pete Alba and I'm a javascript software developer with a background in music/education. Music
                software has become a valuable resource in music
                education, music production and countless of other areas . I would love to work in an area of coding
                that seeks to educate or entertain in some way and I believe my
                ability to inspire my students will help me become a valuable asset in this arena.</p>

            <p>I'm Isaac Nelson and I am a fullstack web developer, a transitioning Marine Corps Veteran, and very soon
                to be a brand new father! In my past I found myself always wanting more out of my jobs, I remember my
                first squad leader telling me that I was always so reserved because the things we were doing were not
                intelectually engaging enough for me. I'll be honest I had no idea what he was talking about until I
                decided to give coding a try last summer. Now I understand, once I engaged in the level of mental
                exercise that programming takes, it felt like my mind was finally stretching it's legs! I love learning
                what it takes to create something new, for the first time in my life I feel real meaning in what I do,
                And I cant wait to do more! </p>
